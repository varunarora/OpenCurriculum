MathJax is the up-to-date ajax framework to display math in HTML environment
using LaTeX and MathML syntax. This module allows to activate MathJax-based
LaTeX rendering on your drupal website. By default, MathJax source is loaded 
automatically from the internet using MathJax Content Delivery Network (CDN).

Currently there is no settings available: MathJax is activated on all nodes and
profile pages. LaTeX inline formula can be entered as $formula$ or \(formula\),
and display formula as $$formula$$ or \[formula\].

Dollar signs in formulas can be escaped using \. < and > signs must be handled
with care as they may be interpreted as start and end of HTML tags: either use
spaces around (e.g. $< dx >$) or the HTML special chars &lt; and &gt; or their
MathJax LaTeX-like equivalents \lt and \gt. More details on MathJax TeX support
on http://www.mathjax.org/resources/docs/?tex.html


INSTALLATION
============

Using MathJax CDN - recommended
-------------------------------

1. Place the "mathjax" folder in your "modules" directory (e.g. sites/all/modules/mathjax).

2. Enable the MathJax module under Administration >> Modules.

3. Test it by adding a LaTeX formula between '$' in any node body (e.g. $2 + 2 = 4$).


Using a local copy of mathjax (relies on libraries module)
----------------------------------------------------------

1. Download and install the "Libraries API" module: uncompress the "libraries"
folder, copy it to your "modules" directory, and enable it under
Administer >> Site building >> Modules.

http://drupal.org/project/libraries

2. Place the "mathjax" folder in your "modules" directory (e.g. sites/all/modules/mathjax).

3. Install third party MathJax software
     Download MathJax 1.1 source from MathJax website (e.g. https://github.com/mathjax/MathJax/zipball/v1.1a)
     Unarchive it into your "libraries" directory (e.g. sites/all/libraries).
     You may need to create the "libraries" directory first.
     Rename it to "mathjax" (lower case).
NB: Relying on libraries module to locate 'mathjax' folder allows you to place
it in a site specific (e.g. sites/mysite/libraries) or default folder
(e.g. sites/all/libraries). Site-specific versions are selected preferentially.

3. Enable the MathJax module under Administration >> Modules.

4. Disable the "Use MathJax CDN" checkbox in Administration >> Configuration >> MathJax (in the Content Authoring section, admin/config/content/mathjax)

5. Test it by adding a LaTeX formula between '$' in any node body (e.g. $2 + 2 = 4$).
