This folder contains testfiles for Mediawiki Filter.

Unfortunately, the current-test procedure is very crude.. We take some
reference-pages from Mediawiki.org's help section, adapt them slightly and (try
to) render them. That's basically it...


For "testing" you need to:

- Upload "example.jpg" to Drupal, call the node "Example"
- Create four nodes containing the reference markup found in this folder.

If it renders without crashing - hooray! :)


Note that

- some default templates
- mediawiki.org templates
- reference images & links
- categories
- languages

do not work work (yet?)
